Dear Codeforces,

You have done so much to become the largest competitive programming website in
the world, while being free and actually caring about users. What started as a
regular contest website has become a host of many regional olympiads from all
over the world and the teacher of many self-educated participants. A team of
developers with burning eyes, lead by Mike Mirzayanov, has overcome large
companies and corporations in this long journey.

With great power comes great responsibility. More and more people start using
Codeforces, and more and more feature requests and ideas are discussed in blogs
and comments. You say you read most comments, but often you don't reply. There
are great ideas that are posted every once in a while because it's difficult to
find these old posts. Eventually, some awesome ideas get forgotten.

This is a repository to help participants to report feature requests, bugs and
wishes in a user-friendly way, and to help Codeforces to judge which features
are most wanted.


## How to report issues

[Create a new issue](https://github.com/dear-codeforces/dear-codeforces/issues/new/choose)
from template. You can report bugs in Codeforces interface or in submission
testing, or send feature requests. For security issues and vulnerabilities,
please contact Mike Mirzayanov directly [via email](mailto:mirzayanovmr@gmail.com)
or [via Telegram](https://t.me/mikemirzayanov). 


## Should I report a well-known issue?

Please make sure that it hasn't been reported before and do submit an issue. The
goal is to collect all issues from all places and become *the* issue tracker.
